This is the first HTML project as part of the Odin Project Foundations course.

It is meant to consolidate basic HTML learning that involves
 - HTML sections like DOCTYPE, head and body
 - elements of formatting like headers, paragraphs
 - creating absolute and relative links
 - inserting images
  - having a consistent directory structure for the project
